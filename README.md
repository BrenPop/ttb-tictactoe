# tic-tac-toe

Hi TwoThreeBird. Thanks for the opportunity to apply for a role at the company.
I have tried to complete the assignment as best I can. Unfortunatly I still need to complete the Vitest step.
It is currently underway and I will update the repo once it is working correctly.
In the mean time I have pushed the rest of the work here.

Please contact me if there are any questions, or if there is anything I can update/change.

Thanks,
Brendan

TODO:

1. Vitest tests need to be done, time constraints and learning the technology has delayed this work.
2. Add the Vitest test check to the github workflow
